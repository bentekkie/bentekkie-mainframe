Scouter<br>
September 2013 ----> Present
<br>
As a scouter, along with my team of other scouters, I am responsible for<br>
developing and carrying out an engaging, educational, and fun program for<br>
a group of 11-14 year olds each week. In addition we go on one weekend camp<br>
every month, where we practice the skills learnt in weekly meetings.<br>

Youth Member<br>
September 2002 ----> August 2015
<br>
As a youth member I went though all the sections of scouting. Throughout<br>
my scouting career I have learnt survival skills such as lighting fires <br>
and tying knots as well as life skills such as how to be independent and<br>
a problem solver. Additionally, as a youth member I helped at many community<br>
events such as distributing meals to homeless individuals or volunteering<br>
at events for local charities.<br>
