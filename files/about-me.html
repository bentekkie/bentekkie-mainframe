About Me: <br>
<br>
I was born in Cape Town, South Africa, grew up in Vancouver, BC and <br>
go to school in Waterloo, ON. The three things I love most in life are <br>
the outdoors, computers and snowboading. So chances are I am always <br>
either working on a new app, hiking a trail in the wilderness, or <br>
ripping down a black diamond on my snowboard.<br>
